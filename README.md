He graduated from the University of Sussex and was an English-Speaking Union fellow at Indiana University, where he received a Ph.D. in History.

He has taught at the University of San Francisco and San Francisco State University and is professor emeritus of History at Notre Dame de Namur University. He has lived in Oakland, California, since 1999 but remains perpetually, even rashly, optimistic about the fortunes of his beloved [Norwich City FC]( https://www.canaries.co.uk/ ).
